# Portfolio Website

This [project](https://notadev900.github.io/Portfolio/) is a personal portfolio website for showcasing the skills, projects, and contact information of me. The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern look.

## Key Features

### HTML
- **Header and Navigation:** A fixed header with a logo and navigation menu links to different sections of the website: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
- **Home Section:** Introduces the developer, featuring a greeting message, a brief description, and links to social media profiles (LinkedIn and GitHub).

- **External Resources:**
  - Google Fonts for custom typography.
  - Boxicons for icon usage (menu, social media icons).
  - A favicon to represent the website in the browser tab.
- **Styling and Scripts:**
